// __aeabi_read_tp() is used by GCC to get a pointer to the thread local
// storage.
//
// This is a special function that can't clobber any registers other than r0 and
// lr. This is done so that calls to this function are very fast.
//
// For the most part, this function is used from user code, which is normally
// written in Thumb. Also, there is no point in placing this code in ITCM
// because any code located in main RAM will need to call a veneer to jump to
// this routine. It's better to place it in regular RAM.
//
// Note: Using TLS from an interrupt handler is problematic. The code uses the
// TLS area of the thread that was interrupted, which may cause weird issues.
// Even when interrupts are nested, the same TLS area is used. In debug builds
// we need to check if this function is called from an interrupt handler to
// detect this situation. The check makes the function twice as slow, so it
// isn't a good idea to keep it in release builds for now.
